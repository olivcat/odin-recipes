    <h1>Death by Chocolate Mousse</h1>
    <img src="img/choc-mousse.webp" alt="Peng chocolate Mousse" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I make this chocolate mousse pie for the holidays. It is the only pie that
      is gone at the end of the night. I use high-quality chocolate chips
      because they are easier to melt. You can use milk or semi-sweet chips. You
      can use any ready-made or cooked pie crust.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Crust</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>21 chocolate sandwich cookies, crushed</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup butter, softened</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups heavy cream, divided</li>
      <li>1 (12-ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Topping</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream, chilled</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a
        9-inch springform pan with 2 3/4-inch sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make crust: Mix together crushed cookies and butter in a medium bowl
        until well combined. Press mixture evenly into the prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
      <li>
        Make filling: Combine 1 cup cream, chocolate chips, vanilla, and salt in
        the top of a double boiler. Heat, stirring occasionally, until chocolate
        is fully melted and mixture is smooth. Pour chocolate mixture into a
        large bowl; cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat 2 cups cream in a second large bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold
        into chocolate mixture until well combined. Pour mixture into cooled
        crust. Chill pie in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours before topping
        and serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make topping: Beat chilled cream and sugar with an electric mixer in a
        medium bowl until stiff. Pipe onto the top of pie with a star tip, or
        spoon dollops onto each slice to serve.
